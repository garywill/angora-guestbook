Version 1.5 -> 1.6


CHANGES
--------

Fix email notification error
Remove dependency for reCaptcha from built-in captcha option
Fix ob_gzhandler warning message (thanks to fox333)
Weaken the requirement for mysql version (will check but won't stop the installation if failed. This is a workaround where mysql version is not given as a number)
Fix a regression introduced in version 1.5 where update script from version 0.7.x fails
Replace eregi with preg_match in error class
Update TinyMCE to version 3.3.9.3
Remove yamli plugin from default tinymce editor (but still manually available with adding rbyamli to tinymce init javascript code)
Add iPad, iPhone and iPod as iOS, and add Blackberry in OS statistics
